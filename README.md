# Tutorial code for manually writing a neural network in Rust language
Rust is an efficient and memory - safe programming language, well - suited for compute - intensive applications. Artificial neural networks happen to be compute - intensive applications. This series of videos aims to combine the two and manually build artificial neural networks from scratch.

The content this series will include:
1. Basics of artificial neural networks
2. Implementing multi - layer neural networks in Rust
3. Training classification models using neural networks implemented in Rust
4. Implementing a handwritten digit recognition model in Rust
5. Accelerating neural networks using CUDA
6. Implementing the training of GPT 1.0 using Rust and CUDA
